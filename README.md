This is a pingsweep utility that can be used to find all active ip addresses on your network (aka LAN)
There are two options available to the user:
1. A quick sweep
  - This sweep is less accurate as it gives less time for devices on the network to respond to the pings, but inherently allows for a quicker sweep
2. An extensive sweep
  - This sweep is more accurate as it gives plenty of time for devices on the network to respond to the pings (and potential arp requests that result from the initial pings)
